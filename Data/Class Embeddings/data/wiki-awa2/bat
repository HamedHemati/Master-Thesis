Bats are mammals of the order Chiroptera; with their forelimbs adapted as wings, they are the only mammals naturally capable of true and sustained flight.
Bats are more manoeuvrable than birds, flying with their very long spread-out digits covered with a thin membrane or patagium.
The head and teeth shape of bats can vary by species. In general, megabats have longer snouts, larger eye sockets and smaller ears, giving them a more dog-like appearance, which is the source of their nickname of "flying foxes".
Bats are the only mammals capable of sustained flight, as opposed to gliding, as in the flying squirrel.
The wings of bats are much thinner and consist of more bones than the wings of birds, allowing bats to manoeuvre more accurately than the latter, and fly with more lift and less drag.
By folding the wings in toward their bodies on the upstroke, they save 35 percent energy during flight.
When not flying, bats hang upside down from their feet, a posture known as roosting.
The eyes of most microbat species are small and poorly developed, leading to poor visual acuity, but no species is blind.
