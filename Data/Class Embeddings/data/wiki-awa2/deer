Deer (singular and plural) are the ruminant mammals forming the family Cervidae. The two main groups are the Cervinae, including the muntjac, the elk (wapiti), the fallow deer and the chital, and the Capreolinae, including the reindeer (caribou), the roe deer and the moose.
In this they differ from permanently horned antelope, which are part of a different family (Bovidae) within the same order of even-toed ungulates (Artiodactyla).
Though of a similar build, deer are strongly distinguished from antelopes by their antlers, which are temporary and regularly regrown unlike the permanent horns of bovids.[3] Characteristics typical of deer include long, powerful legs, a diminutive tail and long ears.[4] Deer exhibit a broad variation in physical proportions.
Coat colour generally varies between red and brown,[11] though it can be as dark as chocolate brown in the tufted deer[12] or have a grayish tinge as in elk.[7] Different species of brocket deer vary from gray to reddish brown in coat colour.[13] Several species such as the chital,[14] the fallow deer[15] and the sika deer[16] feature white spots on a brown coat. Coat of reindeer shows notable geographical variation.
Deer undergo two moults in a year;[11][18] for instance, in red deer the red, thin-haired summer coat is gradually replaced by the dense, greyish brown winter coat in autumn, which in turn gives way to the summer coat in the following spring.[19] Moulting is affected by the photoperiod.
