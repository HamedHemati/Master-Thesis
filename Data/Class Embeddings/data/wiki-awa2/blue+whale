The blue whale (Balaenoptera musculus) is a marine mammal belonging to the baleen whales (Mysticeti).
Long and slender, the blue whale's body can be various shades of bluish-grey dorsally and somewhat lighter underneath.
Blue whales were abundant in nearly all the oceans on Earth until the beginning of the twentieth century.
The blue whale is the largest animal known to have ever lived.
The blue whale has a long tapering body that appears stretched in comparison with the stockier build of other whales.
The head is flat, U-shaped and has a prominent ridge running from the blowhole to the top of the upper lip.
The front part of the mouth is thick with baleen plates; around 300 plates, each around one metre (3.3 feet) long,[26] hang from the upper jaw, running 0.5 m (20 in) back into the mouth.
