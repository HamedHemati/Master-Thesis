An antelope is a member of a number of even-toed ungulate species indigenous to various regions in Africa and Eurasia.
a male common eland can measure 178 cm (70 in) at the shoulder and weigh almost 950 kg (2,090 lb), whereas an adult royal antelope may stand only 24 cm (9.4 in) at the shoulder and weigh a mere 1.5 kg (3.3 lb).
many antelopes have long strides and can run fast.
Antelope have a wide variety of coverings, though most have a dense coat of short fur.
In most species, the coat (pelage) is some variation of a brown colour (or several shades of brown), often with white or pale underbodies.
Antelope are ruminants, so have well-developed molar teeth, which grind cud (food balls stored in the stomach) into a pulp for further digestion.
Their eyes are placed on the sides of their heads, giving them a broad radius of vision with minimal binocular vision.
Their horizontally elongated pupils also help in this respect. Acute senses of smell and hearing give antelope the ability to perceive danger at night out in the open (when predators are often on the prowl).
Many antelope are sexually dimorphic. In most species, both sexes have horns, but those of males tend to be larger. Males tend to be larger than the females.
The size and shape of antelope horns varies greatly. Those of the duikers and dwarf antelopes tend to be simple "spikes".
Many species have ridges in their horns for at least two-thirds the length of their horns, but these ridges are not a direct indicator of age.
