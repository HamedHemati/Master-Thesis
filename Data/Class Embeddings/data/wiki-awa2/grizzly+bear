Although variable in color from blond to nearly black, grizzly bear fur is typically brown with darker legs and commonly white or blond tipped fur on the flank and back.
A pronounced hump appears on their shoulders; the hump is a good way to distinguish a grizzly bear from a black bear, as black bears do not have this hump. Aside from the distinguishing hump a grizzly bear can be identified by a "dished in" profile of their face with short, rounded ears, whereas a black bear has a straight face profile and longer ears.
A grizzly bear can also be identified by its rump, which is lower than its shoulders, while a black bear's rump is higher.[21] A grizzly bear's front claws measure about 2-4 inches in length and a black bear's measure about 1-2 inches in length.
