The Chihuahua is the smallest breed of dog and is named after the state of Chihuahua in Mexico. Chihuahuas come in a wide variety of colors, and two coat lengths.
There are two varieties of Chihuahua â€“ the Smooth Coat (shorthaired) and the Long Coat (longhaired).
Dogs of either coat type may be identified as either "apple head" or "deer head" Chihuahuas, particularly in the United States. Apple heads have rounded heads, close-set eyes, and relatively short ears and legs. Deer heads have flat-topped heads, more widely set eyes, larger ears, and longer, more slender legs. While deer heads were popular in the mid-twentieth century, current breed standards defined by registries such as the American Kennel Club specify the apple head conformation.
Generally, the height ranges between 15 and 23 cm (6 and 9 in);[10] however, some dogs grow as tall as 30 to 38 cm (12 to 15 in).
Chihuahuas come in virtually any color combination, from solid to marked or splashed,[17] allowing for colors from solid black to solid white, spotted, sabled, or a variety of other colors and patterns. Colors and patterns can combine and affect each other, resulting in a very high degree of variation. Common colors are fawn, red, cream, chocolate, brown, mixed, white, and black. No color or pattern is considered more valuable than another.
