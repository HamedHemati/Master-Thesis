The giraffe (Giraffa) is a genus of African even-toed ungulate mammals, the tallest living terrestrial animals and the largest ruminants.
The giraffe's chief distinguishing characteristics are its extremely long neck and legs, its horn-like ossicones, and its distinctive coat patterns.
The giraffe's prehensile tongue is about 45 cm (18 in) long.[48][49] It is purplish-black in colour, perhaps to protect against sunburn, and is useful for grasping foliage, as well as for grooming and cleaning the animal's nose.[53]:27 The upper lip of the giraffe is also prehensile and useful when foraging and is covered in hair to protect against thorns. The tongue, and inside of the mouth are covered in papillae.
Despite its long neck and legs, the giraffe's body is relatively short.[52]:66 Located at both sides of the head, the giraffe's large, bulging eyes give it good all-round vision from its great height.
The coat has dark blotches or patches (which can be orange, chestnut, brown, or nearly black in colour[19]) separated by light hair (usually white or cream in colour[19]). Male giraffes become darker as they age.
The skin of a giraffe is mostly gray.[51] Its thickness allows the animal to run through thorn bush without being punctured.
The front and back legs of a giraffe are about the same length. The radius and ulna of the front legs are articulated by the carpus, which, while structurally equivalent to the human wrist, functions as a knee.
The giraffe has an extremely elongated neck, which can be up to 2–2.4 m (6.6–7.9 ft) in length, accounting for much of the animal's vertical height.
