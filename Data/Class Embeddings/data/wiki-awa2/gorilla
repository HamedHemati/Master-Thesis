Gorillas move around by knuckle-walking, although they sometimes walk bipedally for short distances while carrying food or in defensive situations,[14] and some Mountain Gorillas use other parts of their hand to aid locomotion (Studies of 77 Mountain Gorillas published in 2018 showed 61% only used knuckle walking, but the remainder used knuckle walking plus other parts of their hand - fist walking in ways that donâ€™t use the knuckles, using the backs of their hand, and using their palms)[15].
Adult male gorillas are known as silverbacks due to the characteristic silver hair on their backs reaching to the hips.
The eastern gorilla is more darkly coloured than the western gorilla, with the mountain gorilla being the darkest of all. The mountain gorilla also has the thickest hair. The western lowland gorilla can be brown or grayish with a reddish forehead. In addition, gorillas that live in lowland forests are more slender and agile than the more bulky mountain gorillas. The eastern gorilla also has a longer face and broader chest than the western gorilla.
