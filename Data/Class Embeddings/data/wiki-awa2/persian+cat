The Persian cat is a long-haired breed of cat characterized by its round face and short muzzle. It is also known as the Persian Longhair in the English-speaking countries. A show-style Persian has an extremely long and thick coat, short legs, a wide head with the ears set far apart, large eyes, and an extremely shortened muzzle. The breed was originally established with a short muzzle, but over time, this characteristic has become extremely exaggerated, particularly in North America. Persian cats can have virtually any color or markings. The permissible colors in the breed, in most organizations' breed standards, encompass the entire range of cat coat-pattern variations. CFA base colors are white, black, blue, red, cream, chocolate, and lilac.
