The collie is a distinctive type of herding dog, including many related landraces and standardised breeds. The type originated in Scotland and Northern England. The collie is a medium-sized, fairly lightly built dog, with a pointed snout. Many types have a distinctive white pattern over the shoulders.
Collies are generally medium-sized dogs of about 22 to 32 kg (48 to 70 lb) and light to medium-boned.
Cattle-herding types are more stocky. The fur may be short, flat, or long, and the tail may be smooth, feathered, or bushy. Collies can have both naturally long or naturally bobbed tails. Some breed clubs historically dock the tail. The tail can be carried low with an upward swirl or twist or high over the back. The tail never curls at the base or touches the back.
Each breed can vary in coloration, with the usual base colors being black, black-and-tan, red, red-and-tan, or sable.
They often have white along with the main color, usually under the belly and chest, over the shoulders, and on parts of the face and legs, but sometimes leaving only the head colored â€“ or white may be absent or limited to the chest and toes.
