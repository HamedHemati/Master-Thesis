The beaver (genus Castor) is a large, primarily nocturnal, semiaquatic rodent.
Beavers are known for building dams, canals, and lodges (homes). They are the second-largest rodent in the world (after the capybara).
Their colonies create one or more dams to provide still, deep water to protect against predators, and to float food and building material.
The North American and Eurasian beavers are the only extant members of the family Castoridae, contained in a single genus, Castor.
Eurasian beavers tend to be slightly larger, with larger, less rounded heads, longer, narrower muzzles, thinner, shorter and lighter underfur, narrower, less oval-shaped tails and shorter shin bones, making them less capable of bipedal locomotion than the North American species.
The guard hairs of the Eurasian beaver have a longer hollow medulla at their tips.
Fur colour is also different. Overall, 66% of Eurasian beavers have pale brown or beige fur, 20% have reddish brown, nearly 8% are brown and only 4% have blackish coats.
In North American beavers, 50% have pale brown fur, 25% are reddish brown, 20% are brown and 6% are blackish.
