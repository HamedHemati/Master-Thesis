4 the northern waterthrush is a large new world warbler (and not a thrush , despite the name) .
5  it has a length of 1215 cm (4.75.9 in), wingspan of 2124 cm (8.39.4 in) and weighs between 13 and 25 g (0.46 and 0.88 oz) among standard measurements , the wing chord is 6.8 to 8.2 cm (2.7 to 3.2 in), the tail is 4.5 to 5.7 cm (1.8 to 2.2 in), the bill is 1.1 to 1.2 cm (0.43 to 0.47 in) and the tarsus is 1.9 to 2.3 cm (0.75 to 0.91 in) .
6  on the head , the crown is brown with a white supercilium .
7  the bill is pointed and dark .
8  the throat is lightly streaked brown to black with heavier streaking continuing onto the breast and flanks .

10  sexes are morphologically similar .
11  young birds have buff , rather than white underparts .
