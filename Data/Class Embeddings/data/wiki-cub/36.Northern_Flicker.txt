0 the northern flicker (colaptes auratus) is a medium-sized member of the woodpecker family .
1  it is native to most of north america , parts of central america , cuba , the cayman islands , and is one of the few woodpecker species that migrate .
2  there are over 100 common names for the northern flicker .
3   among them are: yellowhammer , clape , gaffer woodpecker , harry-wicket , heigh-ho , wake-up , walk-up , wick-up , yarrup , and gawker bird .
4   many of these names are attempts at imitating some of its calls .
5 the northern flicker is part of the genus colaptes which encompasses 12 new-world woodpeckers .
6  there are two living and one extinct subspecies of c .
7  auratus species .
8  the existing sub-species were at one time considered separate species but they commonly interbreed where ranges overlap and are now considered one species by the american ornithologists union .
9  whether or not they are separate species is a well-known example of the species problem .
10  adults are brown with black bars on the back and wings .
11  a mid-to-large-sized woodpecker measures 2836 cm (1114 in) in length and 4254 cm (1721 in) in wingspan .
12 the body mass can vary from 86 to 167 g (3.0 to 5.9 oz) .
13  among standard scientific measurements , the wing bone measures 12.217.1 cm (4.86.7 in), the tail measures 7.511.5 cm (3.04.5 in), the bill measures 2.24.3 cm (0.871.69 in) and the tarsus measures 2.23.1 cm (0.871.22 in) .
14  the largest-bodied specimens are from the northern stretches of the species range , such as alaska or newfoundland and labrador , whereas the smallest specimens come from grand cayman island .
15  a necklace-like black patch occupies the upper breast , while the lower breast and belly are beige with black spots .
16  males can be identified by a black or red moustachial stripe at the base of the beak .
17  the tail is dark on top , transitioning to a white rump which is conspicuous in flight .
18 the subspecies plumage varies as described in taxonomy section .
19 this bird's call is a sustained laugh , ki ki ki ki  .
20  .
21  .
22 , more congenial than that of the pileated woodpecker .
23  one may also hear a constant knocking as they often drum on trees or even metal objects to declare territory .
24  like most woodpeckers , northern flickers drum on objects as a form of communication and territory defense .
25  in such cases , the object is to make as loud a noise as possible , and thats why woodpeckers sometimes drum on metal objects .
26  one northern flicker in wyoming could be heard drumming on an abandoned tractor from a half-mile away .
27  like many woodpeckers , its flight is undulating .
28  the repeated cycle of a quick succession of flaps followed by a pause creates an effect comparable to a rollercoaster .
29 according to the audubon guide , "flickers are the only woodpeckers that frequently feed on the ground", probing with their beak , also sometimes catching insects in flight .
30  although they eat fruits , berries , seeds and nuts , their primary food is insects .
31  ants alone can make up 45% of their diet .
32   other invertebrates eaten include flies , butterflies , moths , beetles , and snails .
33  flickers also eat berries and seeds , especially in winter , including poison oak and ivy , dogwood , sumac , wild cherry and grape , bayberries , hackberries , and elderberries , and sunflower and thistle seeds .
34   flickers often go after ants underground (where the nutritious larvae live), hammering at the soil the way other woodpeckers drill into wood .
35  theyve been seen breaking into cow patties to eat insects living within .
36  their tongues can dart out 2 inches beyond the end of the bill to snare prey .
37   as well as eating ants , flickers have a behavior called anting , during which they use the acid from the ants to assist in preening , as it is useful in keeping them free of parasites .
38 look for flickers in open habitats near trees , including woodlands , edges , yards , and parks .
39  in the west you can find them in mountain forests all the way up to treeline .
40  northern flickers generally nest in holes in trees like other woodpeckers .
41  occasionally , theyve been found nesting in old , earthen burrows vacated by belted kingfishers or bank swallows .
42  both sexes help with nest excavation .
43  the entrance hole is about 3 inches in diameter , and the cavity is 13-16 inches deep .
44  the cavity widens at bottom to make room for eggs and the incubating adult .
45  inside , the cavity is bare except for a bed of wood chips for the eggs and chicks to rest on .
46  once nestlings are about 17 days old , they begin clinging to the cavity wall rather than lying on the floor .
47 the oldest known "yellow-shafted" northern flicker lived to be at least 9 years 2 months old , and the oldest red-shafted northern flicker lived to be at least 8 years 9 months old .
48 their breeding habitat consists of forested areas across north america and as far south as central america .
49  they are cavity nesters who typically nest in trees though they will also use posts and birdhouses if sized and situated appropriately .
50  they prefer to excavate their own home though they will reuse and repair damaged or abandoned nests .
51  abandoned flicker nests create habitat for other cavity nesters .
52  flickers are sometimes driven from nesting sites by another cavity nester , european starlings .
53 it takes about 1 to 2 weeks to build the nest which is built by both sexes of the mating pairs .
54  the entrance hole is roughly 5 cm to 10 cm wide .
55   a typical clutch consists of 6 to 8 eggs whose shells are pure white with a smooth surface and high gloss .
56   the eggs are the second largest of the north american woodpecker species , exceeded only by the pileated woodpecker's .
57  incubation is by both sexes for approximately 11 to 12 days .
58   the young are fed by regurgitation and fledge about 25 to 28 days after hatching .
59 northern birds migrate to the southern parts of the range; southern birds are often permanent residents .
